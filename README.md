# Simon Labondance

I am a Full-stack JavaScript web developer with a background in Mathematics and Information Technology. I have recently graduate from [Founders And Coders](http://www.foundersandcoders.com/), an intensive and highly selective web development bootcamp, and I am now looking for new projects where I can continue to enhance my skills.

Logical yet also creative, I love learning new concepts and testing new ideas in my code, and I always strive to find the best solution to problems.
